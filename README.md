# Pavement-Condition-Prediction

This is my final project in Infrastructure Asset Management course 

### Description
- This project is about prediction the pavemnt condition throug building a deteroration model. 
- By comparing the predicted pavement condition index (PCI) to the standard PCI rating scale, we can determine when the worst condition of the pavement will occur. 
- So, by knowing the duration when the condition of road reaches the dangers zoon, they can schedule when they can apply maintenance.
- Also, they can estimate the cost of the maintenance after determining the damage amount from the PCI Scale and preserve some budget for this event.
